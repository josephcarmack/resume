	I am a researcher with a background in computational science seeking opportunities to do research in the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and cognitive computing in order to both deepen and broaden my knowledge and experience.

\vspace{0.5em}  % some vertical spacing

%	I am a research engineer seeking an internship in applied machine learning and artificial intelligence. I firmly believe that machine learning and artificial intelligence will be integral to all important emerging technologies. I have tried and tested technical problem solving skills that are rooted in my background in physics, mathematics, and engineering and corresponding research in these fields. I have developed my own machine learning toolkit in C++ with an emphasis on deep learning. I am prepared to contribute and learn.
